Implement a Flask-based hangman game with difficulty levels, score tracking, and responsive design.
I've set up a Hangman game application with the following features:
✓ Word selection by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
✓ Visual game state tracking with ASCII art hangman display
✓ Score calculation based on difficulty and remaining attempts
✓ Keyboard and on-screen letter selection
✓ Game over modal with win/loss feedback

How does the game feel to play? Can you select a difficulty, make guesses, and see the game progress properly? Is there anything about the interface or gameplay that could be improved?

To push our hangman game to GitHub, I'll need to set up Git in the project and then push the code to a repository. Let me walk you through this process.

First, let's initialize a Git repository and create a proper .gitignore file:


Created .gitignore
Now, let's create a README.md file to describe the project:


Created README.md
Now, let's create a MIT license file for the project:


Created LICENSE
Now, let's initialize Git and perform the first commit:


Executed git init
Let's add all the files to Git and make our initial commit:


Executed git add .

Executed git commit -m "Initial commit of Hangman game"
Now, to push to GitHub, you'll need to create a GitHub repository and connect it to this local repository. Let me guide you through this process.

First, you need to create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this by:

Going to github.com (after logging in)
Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
Select "New repository"
Name your repository (e.g., "hangman-game")
Add a description if you want
Choose public or private
Click "Create repository"
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands to push an existing repository. The commands will look something like this:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
To add this remote repository to your local Git, you'll need to provide me with your GitHub username and repository name. Then I can help you set up the remote and push the code.

Let me know your GitHub username and the name of the repository you created, and I'll help you set up the remote and push the code.

Perfect! Let's set up the remote repository and push your Hangman game to GitHub.

First, let's add the remote repository to your local Git:


Executed git remote add origin https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git
Now, let's make sure we're on the main branch:


Executed git branch -M main
In order to push to GitHub, you'll need to authenticate. The most common way to do this is by:

Using a personal access token (GitHub no longer supports password authentication via the command line)
Using SSH keys
Using the GitHub CLI
For simplicity, I recommend creating a personal access token:

Go to GitHub.com and log in
Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
Go to Settings
Scroll down and click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar
Click on "Personal access tokens" then "Tokens (classic)"
Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
Give it a name (like "Replit Hangman Push")
Select the "repo" scope to allow pushing to repositories
Click "Generate token"
Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
Once you have your token, we can use it to push to GitHub. Let me know when you have your personal access token ready, and I'll help you push the code.

The GitHub repository link for your project will be:

https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game

However, you need to create this repository first on GitHub before you can access it. Here's how to create it:

Go to https://github.com/new
Enter "hangman-game" as the Repository name
Add an optional description like "A simple but engaging web-based Hangman game built with Flask and Bootstrap"
Choose whether to make it Public or Private
Click "Create repository"
Once created, the repository will be available at the link I provided above. After creating the repository, you'll need to provide a personal access token to push your code to GitHub, as I mentioned in my previous message.

I apologize for the confusion. GitHub's interface may have been updated since my last information. Here's an updated guide to create a personal access token:

Go to GitHub.com and log in
Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
Go to "Settings"
Scroll down to the bottom of the left sidebar and look for "Developer settings" (it should be at the very bottom of the sidebar)
If you don't see it, try going directly to this URL: https://github.com/settings/tokens
If you found "Developer settings", click on it, then click on "Personal access tokens"
Click on "Tokens (classic)" or "Fine-grained tokens" (either will work)
Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
Give it a name (like "Replit Hangman Push")
Select the "repo" scope to allow pushing to repositories
Click "Generate token"
Copy the token (important: you won't see it again after leaving this page!)
Alternatively, you can try using the GitHub CLI if it's available in Replit. Let me check if it's installed:


Executed which gh
The GitHub CLI isn't installed. Let's try another approach. Let me check if we can configure Git to use a credential helper:


Executed git config --global credential.helper
Let's try another approach. Since we're in Replit, we can use the Replit Git integration. This might be easier than trying to authenticate through the command line.

Let me get the current Git status to see what files we have ready:


Executed git status
I see that we're on the main branch and our working tree is clean. Since Replit has built-in Git support, here's an easier way to push your code to GitHub:

In the Replit interface, look for a version control icon in the left sidebar (it should look like a branch or fork icon)
Click on it to open the version control panel
You should see options to connect to GitHub
Follow the instructions to connect your Replit account to GitHub
Once connected, you can push your code directly to your GitHub repository
If you're not seeing these options or having trouble with them, here's another approach using a tool called GitHub Deploy which can help simplify the process in Replit:

I'll use the packager tool to install GitHub Deploy:


Installed github-deploy
Now let's see if we can use the Replit Git integration directly. Let me check what Git remotes we have set up:


Executed git remote -v
Great news! I can see that your GitHub repository is already configured as a remote named "origin" pointing to https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git.

To push your code to this repository, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub. Since we're in Replit, the best approach is to use a personal access token. Here's what I recommend:

Create a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub:

Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
Generate a new token with "repo" scope permissions
Copy the token (you'll only see it once)
Then we can use this token to push to GitHub. Let me know when you have your token ready, and we can set up the authentication.

In the meantime, let's make sure the app is running correctly. Let's check our application to make sure it's working as expected:

I'll help you upload your Hangman game to the GitHub repository. To push your code to GitHub, we'll need to set up authentication. Let me guide you through the process.

Since we already have the repository configured as a remote (https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git), we'll need to authenticate to push the code. Let's try using the github-deploy package we installed:


Executed npx github-deploy --help
Let's try a more direct approach using Git. Since we want to authenticate with GitHub, we'll need a personal access token. Let me ask you for that:

To push your Hangman game to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git), I need your GitHub personal access token.

A personal access token (PAT) acts like a password that allows secure access to your GitHub repositories.

You can create one by going to:

GitHub.com → Settings (top-right profile icon) → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
Click "Generate new token" (classic)
Give it a name like "Replit Hangman Push"
Select the "repo" permission scope
Click "Generate token" at the bottom
Copy the displayed token (you'll only see it once)
Please provide this token so I can securely push your code to GitHub.

I understand there might be some confusion with GitHub tokens. Let's try a simpler approach using Replit's built-in Git capabilities.

Replit has updated its interface and the way it handles GitHub authentication. Here are some alternative methods we can try:

Method 1: Use Replit's Git integration (Easiest)
Replit should have a built-in Git tab or version control feature in its interface. Look for:

A Git icon in the left sidebar
Or a "Version Control" option in the menu
Through this interface, you should be able to connect to GitHub and push your code without needing to manually enter tokens.

Method 2: Try direct Git commands with credential caching
Let's try pushing directly with Git commands:


Executed git config --global credential.helper store && git push -u origin main
It seems the direct Git push is taking too long or waiting for credentials. Let's try a different approach.

Method 3: Use GitHub CLI
Let's see if we can install the GitHub CLI (gh) which makes authentication much easier:


Installed gh
Great! The GitHub CLI (gh) is now installed. Let's use it to push your code to GitHub. First, let's authenticate:


Executed gh auth login --web

I understand it's challenging to get the personal access token. Let's try a completely different approach that doesn't require tokens or authentication.

Since you're using Replit, we can create a ZIP archive of your project and then you can download and manually upload it to your GitHub repository using the GitHub web interface. This avoids all authentication issues.

Let's create a ZIP file of your project:


Executed zip -r hangman-game.zip * .[^.]* -x "node_modules/*" -x ".git/*"
Let's install zip first:


Installed zip
Now let's create the ZIP file:


Executed zip -r hangman-game.zip * .[^.]* -x "node_modules/*" -x ".git/*"
Perfect! We've created a ZIP file with your project. Now let's make a cleaner version without the large hidden directories that you don't need:


Executed rm hangman-game.zip && zip -r hangman-game.zip *.py templates/ static/ .gitignore LICENSE README.md
Now let's make sure the ZIP file is downloadable from Replit:


Executed ls -la hangman-game.zip
Great! The ZIP file is now ready. Here's how you can upload it to your GitHub repository:

Instructions to Upload Your Code to GitHub:
Download the ZIP file from Replit:

Click on the "Files" tab in the Replit sidebar
Find hangman-game.zip in the file list
Right-click on it and select "Download" to save it to your computer
Upload to GitHub:

Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game
If the repository is empty:
Click the "uploading an existing file" link
If it has files already:
Click the "Add file" button → "Upload files"
Drag the hangman-game.zip file you downloaded OR click to browse and select it
Add a commit message like "Upload complete Hangman game"
Click "Commit changes"
Extract files (if needed):

If you want the files extracted rather than just uploading the ZIP file, you'll need to:
Unzip the file on your computer
Upload all the extracted files to GitHub instead of the ZIP file
This method avoids all the authentication issues while still getting your code to GitHub.

Would you like me to show you how to add any additional files or make any improvements to the game before you upload it?

Now let's make sure our files are ready to be pushed. Let's check the current Git status:


Executed git status
Great! The working tree is clean, which means all our files are already committed. Let's now push your code to GitHub:


Executed git push -u origin main

Executed git remote set-url origin https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git
Now let's try pushing again:


Executed git push -u origin main
We're still encountering permission issues. Let's first verify what repository we're trying to push to:


Executed git remote -v
There seems to be an issue with the remote URL format. Let's fix it by setting the remote URL properly:


Executed git remote remove origin && git remote add origin https://github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git
Now let's try pushing with the GITHUB_TOKEN explicitly in the command:


Executed git push -u https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/yamitmehta/hangman-game.git main
I'm still seeing permission issues. The token might not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository, or there might be another authentication issue. Let's check the current state of our application and ensure it's working correctly while we troubleshoot GitHub issues:
